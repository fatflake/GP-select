% NC NOTES
%
% Cover Letter
%
% A cover letter must be provided with your submission. The following three items must be acknowledged:
%
% Title of the paper.
% A statement that none of the material has been published or is under consideration for publication elsewhere.
% For multi-author papers, the journal editors will assume that all the authors have been involved with the work and have approved the manuscript and agree to its submission
%
% - Concisely summarizes why your paper is a valuable addition to the scientific literature
% - Briefly relates your study to previously published work
% - Specifies the type of article you are submitting (for example, research article, systematic review, meta-analysis, clinical trial)
% - Describes any prior interactions with PLOS regarding the submitted manuscript
% - Suggests appropriate PLOS ONE Academic Editors to handle your manuscript (view a complete listing of our academic editors)
% - Lists any recommended or opposed reviewers
%
%
% Yeah the cover letter does not deserve that..,.
% And besides since the paper wasn't at a conference the cover letter is pretty much decorative 
% It's only useful if you're explaining why the journal version is different from the conference version

\opening{Dear Neural Computation editorial board,}

We would like to thank the editior as well as the reviewers for their insightful and helpful comments that we feel strengthen the manuscript.  We have addressed each point, enumerated below, and have additionally included code to illustrate intuitively how our method works. These changes are highlighted in \textcolor{blue}{blue} in the manuscript.

Reviewer 1 modifications:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Joerg? add crap?
    
    \item Modified the sentence as follows: 
As such, the learned function does not have to be a completely accurate
indication of latent variable predictivity, as long as the relative importance of the states
likely to contribute posterior probability mass is preserved.

\end{enumerate}


Reviewer 2 modifications:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item May be that we don't need enumerate for these mods because most are super minor
\end{enumerate}

Furthermore, as the Gaussian Mixture Model in Section 5.2 illustrates visually and intuitively how our approach works, and we can explicitly visualize the effect of different selection functions, we have included an iPython Notebook with a code illustration.
