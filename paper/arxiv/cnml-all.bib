    abstract     = "We propose a novel framework for approximations to intractable probabilistic models which is based on a free energy formulation. The approximation can be understood from replacing an average over the original intractable distribution with a tractable one. It requires two tractable probability distributions which are made consistent on a set of moments and encode different features of the original intractable distribution. In this way we are able to use Gaussian approximations for models with discrete or bounded variables which allow us to include non-trivial correlations which are neglected in many other methods.
We test the framework on toy benchmark problems for binary variables on fully connected graphs and {2D} grids and compare with other methods, such as loopy belief propagation. Good performance is already achieved by using single nodes as tractable substructures. Significant improvements are obtained when a spanning tree is used instead."

@Inproceedings{sparseGP,
abstract     = {<p>We present a framework for sparse Gaussian process (GP) methods which uses
                forward selection with criteria based on information-theoretical principles,
                previously suggested for active learning. In contrast to most previous work on
                sparse GPs, our goal is not only to learn sparse predictors (which can be
                evaluated in O(d) rather than O(n), d ll  n, n the number of training points),
                but also to perform training under strong restrictions on time and memory
                requirements. The scaling of our method is at most O(n d<sup>2</sup>), and in
                large real-world classification experiments we show that it can match prediction
                performance of the popular support vector machine (SVM), yet it requires only a
                fraction of the training time. In contrast to the SVM, our approximation produces
                estimates of predictive probabilities (`error bars'), allows for Bayesian model
                selection and is less complex in implementation.</p>},

and applications of sparse representation, reflecting the key role the subject
plays in today's signal processing. The book clearly presents the standard
representations with Fourier, wavelet and time-frequency transforms, and the
construction of orthogonal bases with fast algorithms. The central concept of
sparsity is explained and applied to signal compression, noise reduction, and
inverse problems, while coverage is given to sparse representations in
redundant dictionaries, super-resolution and compressive sensing applications.}},

    as identically shaped, matching reaction times were measured for
    pairs of simultaneously presented random figures. In three experiments,
    reaction time for correct reactions to test pairs of figures of the
    same shape and orientation consistently increased approximately linearly
    as a function of the linear size ratio of the figures. In the second
    experiment, where this ratio was defined for control pairs as well
    as for test pairs, reaction time for correct reactions to control
    pairs showed a similar increase as a function of size ratio. The
    results suggest that the task was performed by a gradual process
    of mental size transformation of one of the members of each pair
    of figures to the format of the other one.},

@article{CassenaerEtAl2007,
	Abstract = {Odour representations in insects undergo progressive transformations
    and decorrelation from the receptor array to the presumed site of
    odour learning, the mushroom body. There, odours are represented
    by sparse assemblies of Kenyon cells in a large population. Using
    intracellular recordings in vivo, we examined transmission and plasticity
    at the synapse made by Kenyon cells onto downstream targets in locusts.
    We find that these individual synapses are excitatory and undergo
    hebbian spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) on a +/-25 ms timescale.
    When placed in the context of odour-evoked Kenyon cell activity (a
    20-Hz oscillatory population discharge), this form of STDP enhances
    the synchronization of the Kenyon cells' targets and thus helps preserve
    the propagation of the odour-specific codes through the olfactory
    system.},

	Abstract = {Olfactory processing in the insect antennal lobe is a highly dynamic
    process, yet it has been studied primarily with static step stimuli.
    To approximate the rapid odor fluctuations encountered in nature,
    we presented flickering "white-noise" odor stimuli to the antenna
    of the locust and recorded spike trains from antennal lobe projection
    neurons (PNs). The responses varied greatly across PNs and across
    odors for the same PN. Surprisingly, this diversity across the population
    was highly constrained, and most responses were captured by a quantitative
    model with just 3 parameters. Individual PNs were found to communicate
    odor information at rates up to approximately 4 bits/s. A small group
    of PNs was sufficient to provide an accurate representation of the
    dynamic odor time course, whose quality was maximal for fluctuations
    of frequency approximately 0.8 Hz. We develop a simple model for
    the encoding of dynamic odor stimuli that accounts for many prior
    observations on the population response.},

    network, the Boltzmann machine, and several variants of hidden Markov
    models, in which it is infeasible to run exact inference algorithms.
    We then introduce variational methods, which exploit laws of large
    numbers to transform the original graphical model into a simplified
    graphical model in which inference is efficient. Inference in the
    simpified model provides bounds on probabilities of interest in the
    original model. We describe a general framework for generating variational
    transformations based on convex duality. Finally we return to the
    examples and demonstrate how variational algorithms can be formulated

@article{KoerdingEtAl2003,
	Abstract = {An emerging paradigm analyses in what respect the properties of the
    nervous system reflect properties of natural scenes. It is hypothesized
    that neurons form sparse representations of natural stimuli: each
    neuron should respond strongly to some stimuli while being inactive
    upon presentation of most others. For a given network, sparse representations
    need fewest spikes, and thus the nervous system can consume the least
    energy. To obtain optimally sparse responses the receptive fields
    of simulated neurons are optimized. Algorithmically this is identical
    to searching for basis functions that allow coding for the stimuli
    with sparse coefficients. The problem is identical to maximizing
    the log likelihood of a generative model with prior knowledge of
    natural images. It is found that the resulting simulated neurons
    share most properties of simple cells found in primary visual cortex.
    Thus, forming optimally sparse representations is a very compact
    approach to describing simple cell properties. Many ways of defining
    sparse responses exist and it is widely believed that the particular
    choice of the sparse prior of the generative model does not significantly
    influence the estimated basis functions. Here we examine this assumption
    more closely. We include the constraint of unit variance of neuronal
    activity, used in most studies, into the objective functions. We
    then analyze learning on a database of natural (cat-cam) visual stimuli.
    We show that the effective objective functions are largely dominated
    by the constraint, and are therefore very similar. The resulting
    receptive fields show some similarities but also qualitative differences.
    Even for coefficient values for which the objective functions are
    dissimilar, the distributions of coefficients are similar and do
    not match the priors of the assumed generative model. In conclusion,
    the specific choice of the sparse prior is relevant, as is the choice
    of additional constraints, such as normalization of variance.},

	Abstract = {Now that the study of consciousness is warmly embraced by cognitive
    scientists, much confusion seems to arise between the concepts of
    visual attention and visual awareness. Often, visual awareness is
    equated to what is in the focus of attention. There are, however,
    two sets of arguments to separate attention from awareness: a psychological/theoretical
    one and a neurobiological one. By combining these arguments I present
    definitions of visual attention and awareness that clearly distinguish
    between the two, yet explain why attention and awareness are so intricately
    related. In fact, there seems more overlap between mechanisms of
    memory and awareness than between those of attention and awareness.},

    Replicating similar identification studies in which brief, masked

    reduced the efficiency of recognition. Mirroring the findings in
    speeded picture naming studies (e.g., Jolicoeur, 1985; Jolicoeur
    & Milliken, 1989), but in contrast to those of Lawson and Jolicoeur
    (1998), orientation effects were found over a wide range of views
    and were attenuated but not eliminated with experience with a given
    object. The results bridge the findings from unspeeded verification
    and speeded naming tasks. They suggest that the same orientation-sensitive

	Abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There
    is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations
    in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition
    rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains
    or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate
    an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to
    learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast
    to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector
    quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations.
    Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other
    methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints
    lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive,
    not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization
    is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge
    by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never
    negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

	Abstract = {Sparse coding provides a class of algorithms for finding succinct
    representations of stimuli; given only unlabeled input data, it discovers
    basis functions that capture higher-level features in the data. However,
    finding sparse codes remains a very difficult computational problem.
    In this paper, we present efficient sparse coding algorithms that
    are based on iteratively solving two convex optimization problems:
    an L1-regularized least squares problem and an L2-constrained least
    squares problem. We propose novel algorithms to solve both of these
    optimization problems. Our algorithms result in a significant speedup
    for sparse coding, allowing us to learn larger sparse codes than
    possible with previously described algorithms. We apply these algorithms
    to natural images and demonstrate that the inferred sparse codes
    exhibit end-stopping and non-classical receptive field surround suppression
    and, therefore, may provide a partial explanation for these two phenomena

	Abstract = {Traditional views of visual processing suggest that early visual neurons
    in areas V1 and V2 are static spatiotemporal filters that extract
    local features from a visual scene. The extracted information is
    then channeled through a feedforward chain of modules in successively
    higher visual areas for further analysis. Recent electrophysiological
    recordings from early visual neurons in awake behaving monkeys reveal
    that there are many levels of complexity in the information processing
    of the early visual cortex, as seen in the long-latency responses
    of its neurons. These new findings suggest that activity in the early
    visual cortex is tightly coupled and highly interactive with the
    rest of the visual system. They lead us to propose a new theoretical
    setting based on the mathematical framework of hierarchical Bayesian
    inference for reasoning about the visual system. In this framework,
    the recurrent feedforward/feedback loops in the cortex serve to integrate
    top-down contextual priors and bottom-up observations so as to implement
    concurrent probabilistic inference along the visual hierarchy. We
    suggest that the algorithms of particle filtering and Bayesian-belief
    propagation might model these interactive cortical computations.
    We review some recent neurophysiological evidences that support the
    plausibility of these ideas.},

	Abstract = {Visual perception involves the grouping of individual elements into
    coherent patterns that reduce the descriptive complexity of a visual
    scene. The physiological basis of this perceptual simplification
    remains poorly understood. We used functional MRI to measure activity
    in a higher object processing area, the lateral occipital complex,
    and in primary visual cortex in response to visual elements that
    were either grouped into objects or randomly arranged. We observed
    significant activity increases in the lateral occipital complex and
    concurrent reductions of activity in primary visual cortex when elements
    formed coherent shapes, suggesting that activity in early visual
    areas is reduced as a result of grouping processes performed in higher
    areas. These findings are consistent with predictive coding models
    of vision that postulate that inferences of high-level areas are
    subtracted from incoming sensory information in lower areas through
    cortical feedback.},

@article{Reidl2007,
	Abstract = {In the vertebrate brain external stimuli are often represented in
    distinct functional domains distributed across the cortical surface.
    Fast imaging techniques used to measure patterns of population activity
    record movies with many pixels and many frames, i.e., data sets with
    high dimensionality. Here we demonstrate that principal component
    analysis (PCA) followed by spatial independent component analysis
    (sICA), can be exploited to reduce the dimensionality of data sets
    recorded in the olfactory bulb and the somatosensory cortex of mice
    as well as the visual cortex of monkeys, without loosing the stimulus-specific
    responses. Different neuronal populations are separated based on
    their stimulus-specific spatiotemporal activation. Both, spatial
    and temporal response characteristics can be objectively obtained,
    simultaneously. In the olfactory bulb, groups of glomeruli with different
    response latencies can be identified. This is shown for recordings
    of olfactory receptor neuron input measured with a calcium-sensitive
    axon tracer and for network dynamics measured with the voltage-sensitive
    dye RH 1838. In the somatosensory cortex, barrels responding to the
    stimulation of single whiskers can be automatically detected. In
    the visual cortex orientation columns can be extracted. In all cases
    artifacts due to movement, heartbeat or respiration were separated
    from the functional signal by sICA and could be removed from the
    data set. sICA following PCA is therefore a powerful technique for
    data compression, unbiased analysis and dissection of imaging data
    of population activity, collected with high spatial and temporal
    resolution.},

@article{SchraderEtAl2009,
	Abstract = {Experimental data suggests that a first hypothesis about the content
    of a complex visual scene is available as early as 150 ms after stimulus
    presentation. Other evidence suggests that recognition in the visual
    cortex of mammals is a bidirectional, often top-down driven process.
    Here, we present a spiking neural network model that demonstrates
    how the cortex can use both strategies: Faced with a new stimulus,
    the cortex first tries to catch the gist of the scene. The gist is
    then fed back as global hypothesis to influence and redirect further
    bottom-up processing. We propose that these two modes of processing
    are carried out in different layers of the cortex. A cortical column
    may, thus, be primarily defined by the specific connectivity that
    links neurons in different layers into a functional circuit. Given
    an input, our model generates an initial hypothesis after only a
    few milliseconds. The first wave of action potentials traveling up
    the hierarchy activates representations of features and feature combinations.
    In most cases, the correct feature representation is activated strongest
    and precedes all other candidates with millisecond precision. Thus,
    our model codes the reliability of a response in the relative latency
    of spikes. In the subsequent refinement stage where high-level activity
    modulates lower stages, this activation dominance is propagated back,
    influencing its own afferent activity to establish a unique decision.
    Thus, top-down influence de-activates representations that have contributed
    to the initial hypothesis about the current stimulus, comparable
    to predictive coding. Features that do not match the top-down prediction
    trigger an error signal that can be the basis for learning new representations.},

    algorithms for dealing with blind signal separation problems. In
    this paper, we first present a novel ICA estimation algorithm, initialization
    constrained FastICA (IC-FastICA), through combining the technical
    merits of these two approaches. Then, a performance comparison study
    on these three approaches is conducted through the simulations on
    some standard benchmark data. The experimental results demonstrate
    that the IC-FastICA achieves higher performances on unmixing error
    and signal noise ratio while appreciably increasing computation cost.},

    is investigated systematically for the case of face recognition.
    Images are represented by rectangular graphs labeled with jets, based

    matching algorithms is made. The simple methods presented in this

    i.e. different facial expression or 11$\,^{\circ}$ rotation in depth. On a 22$\,^{\circ}$

    and correspondence-based model for invariant face recognition. By
    recurrently integrating information about feature similarities, spatial
    feature relations, and facial structure stored in memory, the system
    evaluates face identity (�what�-information) and face position (�where�-information)
    using explicit representations for both. The network consists of
    three functional layers of processing, (1) an input layer for image
    representation, (2) a middle layer for recurrent information integration,
    and (3) a gallery layer for memory storage. Each layer consists of
    cortical columns as functional building blocks that are modeled in
    accordance with recent experimental findings. In numerical simulations
    we apply the system to standard benchmark databases for face recognition.
    We find that recognition rates of our biologically inspired approach
    lie in the same range as recognition rates of recent and purely functionally
    motivated systems.},

	Abstract = {1. We have examined the responses of simple cells in the cat's atriate cortex to visual patterns that were designed to reveal the extent to which these cells may be considered to sum light-evoked influences linearly across their receptive fields. We used one-dimensional luminance-modulated bars and grating as stimuli; their orientation was always the same as the preferred orientation of the neurone under study. The stimuli were presented on an oscilloscope screen by a digital computer, which also accumulated neuronal responses and controlled a randomized sequence of stimulus presentations. 2. The majority of simple cells respond to sinusoidal gratings that are moving or whose contrast is modulated in time in a manner consistent with the hypothesis that they have linear spatial summation. Their responses to moving gratings of all spatial frequencies are modulated in synchrony with the passage of the gratings' bars across their receptive fields, and they do not produce unmodulated responses even at the highest spatial frequencies. Many of these cells respond to temporally modulated stationary gratings simply by changing their response amplitude sinusoidally as the spatial phase of the grating the grating is varied. Nonetheless, their behavior appears to indicate linear spatial summation, since we show in an Appendix that the absence of a 'null' phase in a visual neurone need not indicate non-linear spatial summation, and further that a linear neurone lacking a 'null' phase should give responses of the form that we have observed in this type of simple cell. 3. A minority of simple cells appears to have significant non-linearities of spatial summation. These neurones respond to moving gratings of high spatial frequency with a partially or totally unmodulated elevation of firing rate. They have no 'null' phases when tested with stationary gratings, and reveal their non-linearity by giving responses to gratings of some spatial phases that are composed partly or wholly of even harmonics of the stimulus frequency ('on-off' responses). 4. We compared simple receptive fields with their sensitivity to sinusoidal gratings of different spatial frequencies. Qualitatively, the most sensitive subregions of simple cells' receptive fields are roughly the same width as the individual bars of the gratings to which they are most sensitive. Quantitatively, their receptive field profiles measured with thin stationary lines, agree well with predicted profiles derived by Fourier synthesis of their spatial frequency tuning curves.},

	Abstract = {The spatial receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian striate cortex have been reasonably well described physiologically and can be characterized as being localized, oriented, and bandpass, comparable with the basis functions of wavelet transforms. Previously, we have shown that these receptive field properties may be accounted for in terms of a strategy for producing a sparse distribution of output activity in response to natural images. Here, in addition to describing this work in a more expansive fashion, we examine the neurobiological implications of sparse coding. Of particular interest is the case when the code is overcomplete---i.e., when the number of code elements is greater than the effective dimensionality of the input space. Because the basis functions are non-orthogonal and not linearly independent of each other, sparsifying the code will recruit only those basis functions necessary for representing a given input, and so the input-output function will deviate from being purely linear. These deviations from linearity provide a potential explanation for the weak forms of non-linearity observed in the response properties of cortical simple cells, and they further make predictions about the expected interactions among units in response to naturalistic stimuli.},

Basis pursuit denoising is a sparse approximation technique in which a function is reconstructed by using a small number of basis functions chosen from a large set (the dictionary).

In this article, we show that the same principle of independence maximization can explain the emergence of phase- and shift-invariant features, similar to those found in complex cells. This new kind of emergence is obtained by maximizing the independence between norms of projections on linear subspaces (instead of the independence of simple linear filter outputs).

	Abstract = {In this paper we discuss a new perspective on how the central nervous system (CNS) represents and solves some of the most fundamental computational problems of motor control. In particular, we consider the task of transforming a planned limb movement into an adequate set of motor commands. To carry out this task the CNS must solve a complex inverse dynamic problem. This problem involves the transformation from a desired motion to the forces that are needed to drive the limb. The inverse dynamic problem is a hard computational challenge because of the need to coordinate multiple limb segments and because of the continuous changes in the mechanical properties of the limbs and of the environment with which they come in contact. A number of studies of motor learning have provided support for the idea that the CNS creates, updates and exploits internal representations of limb dynamics in order to deal with the complexity of inverse dynamics. Here we discuss how such internal representations are likely to be built by combining the modular primitives in the spinal cord as well as other building blocks found in higher brain structures. Experimental studies on spinalized frogs and rats have led to the conclusion that the premotor circuits within the spinal cord are organized into a set of discrete modules. Each module, when activated, induces a specific force field and the simultaneous activation of multiple modules leads to the vectorial combination of the corresponding fields. We regard these force fields as computational primitives that are used by the CNS for generating a rich grammar of motor behaviours.},

An emerging viewpoint is that the CNS uses synergies to simplify the control of the hand. Previous work has shown that static hand postures for mimed grasps can be described by a few principal components in which the higher order components explained only a small fraction of the variance yet provided meaningful information. Extending that earlier work, this study addressed whether the entire act of grasp can be described by a small number of postural synergies and whether these synergies are similar for different grasps. Five right-handed adults performed five types of reach-to-grasps including power grasp, power grasp with a lift, precision grasp, and mimed power grasp and mimed precision grasp of 16 different objects. The object shapes were cones, cylinders, and spindles, systematically varied in size to produce a large range of finger joint angle combinations. Three-dimensional reconstructions of 21 positions on the hand and wrist throughout the reach-to-grasp were obtained using a four-camera video system. Singular value decomposition on the temporal sequence of the marker positions was used to identify the common patterns ("eigenpostures") across the 16 objects for each task and their weightings as a function of time. The first eigenposture explained an average of 97.3 \{+/-\} 0.89\% (mean \{+/-\} SD) of the variance of the hand shape, and the second another 1.9 \{+/-\} 0.85\%. The first eigenposture was characterized by an open hand configuration that opens and closes during reach. The second eigenposture contributed to the control of the thumb and long fingers, particularly in the opening of the hand during the reach and the closing in preparation for object grasp. The eigenpostures and their temporal evolutions were similar across subjects and grasps. The higher order eigenpostures, although explaining only small amounts of the variance, contributed to the movements of the fingers and thumb. These findings suggest that much of reach-to-grasp is effected using a base posture with refinements in finger and thumb positions added in time to yield unique hand shapes.},

For example, images of a person walking can be mapped to a one-dimensional manifold that measures the phase of the person's gait. However, when the object is moving around the frame and being occluded by other objects, standard manifold modeling techniques (e.g., principal components analysis, factor analysis, locally linear embedding) try to account for global motion and occlusion. We show how factor analysis can be incorporated into a generative model of layered, 2.5-dimensional vision, to jointly locate objects, resolve occlusion ambiguities, and learn models of the appearance manifolds of objects. We demonstrate the algorithm on a video consisting of four occluding objects, two of which are people who are walking, and occlude each other for most of the duration of the video. Whereas standard manifold modeling techniques fail to extract information about the gaits, the layered model successfully extracts a periodic representation of the gait of each person.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

	Abstract = {Coupling of actuators into motor synergies has been observed repeatedly, and is traditionally interpreted as a strategy for simplifying complex coordination problems. This view implies a small number of task-independent synergies. We have shown that optimal feedback control also gives rise to synergies in the absence of any simplification; the structure and number of such optimal synergies depends on the task. To compare these hypotheses, we recorded hand postures from a range of complex manipulation task. The structure of the synergies we extracted (via PCA) was task-dependent, and their number significantly exceeded previous observations in a simpler grasping task. Our results lend support to an optimal control explanation rather than a "simplicity" explanation.},

	Abstract = {Selecting the appropriate muscle pattern to achieve a given goal is an extremely complex task because of the dimensionality of the search space and because of the nonlinear and dynamical nature of the transformation between muscle activity and movement. To investigate whether the central nervous system uses a modular architecture to achieve motor coordination we characterized the motor output over a large set of movements. We recorded electromyographic activity from 13 muscles of the hind limb of intact and freely moving frogs during jumping, swimming, and walking in naturalistic conditions. We used multidimensional factorization techniques to extract invariant amplitude and timing relationships among the muscle activations. A decomposition of the instantaneous muscle activations as combinations of nonnegative vectors, synchronous muscle synergies, revealed a spatial organization in the muscle patterns. A decomposition of the same activations as a combination of temporal sequences of nonnegative vectors, time-varying muscle synergies, further uncovered specific characteristics in the muscle activation waveforms. A mixture of synergies shared across behaviors and synergies for specific behaviors captured the invariances across the entire dataset. These results support the hypothesis that the motor controller has a modular organization.},

	Abstract = {Research into methods for reasoning under uncertainty is currently one of the most exciting areas of artificial intelligence, largely because it has recently become possible to record, store, and process large amounts of data. While impressive achievements have been made in pattern classification problems such as handwritten character recognition, face detection, speaker identification, and prediction of gene function, it is even more exciting that researchers are on the verge of introducing systems that can perform large-scale combinatorial analyses of data, decomposing the data into interacting components. For example, computational methods for automatic scene analysis are now emerging in the computer vision community. These methods decompose an input image into its constituent objects, lighting conditions, motion patterns, etc. Two of the main challenges are finding effective representations and models in specific applications and finding efficient algorithms for inference and learning in these models. In this paper, we advocate the use of graph-based probability models and their associated inference and learning algorithms. We review exact techniques and various approximate, computationally efficient techniques, including iterated conditional modes, the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, Gibbs sampling, the mean field method, variational techniques, structured variational techniques and the sum-product algorithm ("loopy" belief propagation). We describe how each technique can be applied in a vision model of multiple, occluding objects and contrast the behaviors and performances of the techniques using a unifying cost function, free energy.},

	Abstract = {A fundamental task of vision is to group the image elements that belong to one object and to segregate them from other objects and the background. This review provides a conceptual framework of how perceptual grouping may be implemented in the visual cortex. According to this framework, two mechanisms are responsible for perceptual grouping: base-grouping and incremental grouping. Base-groupings are coded by single neurons tuned to multiple features, like the combination of a color and an orientation. They are computed rapidly because they reflect the selectivity of feedforward connections. However, not all conceivable feature combinations are coded by dedicated neurons. Therefore, a second, flexible form of grouping is required called incremental grouping. Incremental grouping enhances the responses of neurons coding features that are bound in perception, but it takes more time than does base-grouping because it relies also on horizontal and feedback connections. The modulation of neuronal response strength during incremental grouping has a correlate in psychology because attention is directed to those features that are labeled by the enhanced neuronal response.},

	Abstract = {Dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis and factor analysis are used to discover a linear mapping between high-dimensional data samples and points in a lower-dimensional subspace. Previously, Frey and Jojic introduced transformation-invariant component analysis (TCA) to learn a linear mapping, invariant to a set of known form of global transformations. However, parameter estimation in that model using the previously-proposed expectation maximization (EM) algorithm required scalar operations in the order of N 2 where N is the dimensionality of each training example. This is prohibitive for many applications of interest such as modeling mid-to large-size images, where, for instance, N may be as high as 786432 (512×512 RGB image). In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm that reduces the computational requirements to order of N log N . With this speedup, we show the effectiveness of transformation-invariant component analysis in various applications including tracking, learning video textures, clustering, object recognition and object detection in images. Software for TCA can be downloaded from http://www.psi.toronto.edu/fastTCA.htm .},

We describe a locally competitive algorithm (LCA) that solves a collection of sparse coding principles minimizing a weighted combination of mean-squared error and a coefficient cost function. LCAs are designed to be implemented in a dynamical system composed of many neuron-like elements operating in parallel. These algorithms use thresholding functions to induce local (usually one-way) inhibitory competitions between nodes to produce sparse representations. LCAs produce coefficients with sparsity levels comparable to the most popular centralized sparse coding algorithms while being readily suited for neural implementation. Additionally, LCA coefficients for video sequences demonstrate inertial properties that are both qualitatively and quantitatively more regular (i.e., smoother and more predictable) than the coefficients produced by greedy algorithms.},

	Abstract = {For the past 10 years it has become clear that biological movement is made up of sub-routine type blocks, or motor primitives , with a central controller timing the activation of these blocks, creating synergies of muscle activation. This paper shows that it is possible to use a factorial hidden Markov model to infer primitives in handwriting data. These primitives are not predefined in terms of location of occurrence within the handwriting, and they are not limited or defined by a particular character set. Also, the variation in the data can to a large extent be explained by timing variation in the triggering of the primitives. Once an appropriate set of primitives has been inferred, the characters can be represented as a set of timings of primitive activations, along with variances, giving a very compact representation of the character. Separating the motor system into a motor primitive part, and a timing control gives us a possible insight into how we might create scribbles on paper.},

@article{ZhaopingJingling2008,
	Abstract = {Visual object recognition and sensitivity to image features are largely influenced by contextual inputs. We study influences by contextual bars on the bias to perceive or infer the presence of a target bar, rather than on the sensitivity to image features. Human observers judged from a briefly presented stimulus whether a target bar of a known orientation and shape is present at the center of a display, given a weak or missing input contrast at the target location with or without a context of other bars. Observers are more likely to perceive a target when the context has a weaker rather than stronger contrast. When the context can perceptually group well with the would-be target, weak contrast contextual bars bias the observers to perceive a target relative to the condition without contexts, as if to fill in the target. Meanwhile, high-contrast contextual bars, regardless of whether they group well with the target, bias the observers to perceive no target. A Bayesian model of visual inference is shown to account for the data well, illustrating that the context influences the perception in two ways: (1) biasing observers' prior belief that a target should be present according to visual grouping principles, and (2) biasing observers' internal model of the likely input contrasts caused by a target bar. According to this model, our data suggest that the context does not influence the perceived target contrast despite its influence on the bias to perceive the target's presence, thereby suggesting that cortical areas beyond the primary visual cortex are responsible for the visual inferences.},

	Abstract = {Correctly interpreting a natural image requires dealing properly with the effects of occlusion, and hence, contour grouping across occlusions is a major component of many natural visual tasks. To better understand the mechanisms of contour grouping across occlusions, we (a) measured the pair-wise statistics of edge elements from contours in natural images, as a function of edge element geometry and contrast polarity, (b) derived the ideal Bayesian observer for a contour occlusion task where the stimuli were extracted directly from natural images, and then (c) measured human performance in the same contour occlusion task. In addition to discovering new statistical properties of natural contours, we found that na\"{\i}ve human observers closely parallel ideal performance in our contour occlusion task. In fact, there was no region of the four-dimensional stimulus space (three geometry dimensions and one contrast dimension) where humans did not closely parallel the performance of the ideal observer (i.e., efficiency was approximately constant over the entire space). These results reject many other contour grouping hypotheses and strongly suggest that the neural mechanisms of contour grouping are tightly related to the statistical properties of contours in natural images.},

	Abstract = {Contrast statistics of the majority of natural images conform to a Weibull distribution. This property of natural images may facilitate efficient and very rapid extraction of a scene's visual gist. Here we investigated whether a neural response model based on the Weibull contrast distribution captures visual information that humans use to rapidly identify natural scenes. In a learning phase, we measured EEG activity of 32 subjects viewing brief flashes of 700 natural scenes. From these neural measurements and the contrast statistics of the natural image stimuli, we derived an across subject Weibull response model. We used this model to predict the EEG responses to 100 new natural scenes and estimated which scene the subject viewed by finding the best match between the model predictions and the observed EEG responses. In almost 90 percent of the cases our model accurately predicted the observed scene. Moreover, in most failed cases, the scene mistaken for the observed scene was visually similar to the observed scene itself. Similar results were obtained in a separate experiment in which 16 other subjects where presented with artificial occlusion models of natural images. Together, these results suggest that Weibull contrast statistics of natural images contain a considerable amount of visual gist information to warrant rapid image identification.},

	Abstract = {The retinal image of visual objects can vary drastically with changes of viewing angle. Nevertheless, our visual system is capable of recognizing objects fairly invariant of viewing angle. Under natural viewing conditions, different views of the same object tend to occur in temporal proximity, thereby generating temporal correlations in the sequence of retinal images. Such spatial and temporal stimulus correlations can be exploited for learning invariant representations. We propose a biologically plausible mechanism that implements this learning strategy using the principle of self-organizing maps. We developed a network of spiking neurons that uses spatiotemporal correlations in the inputs to map different views of objects onto a topographic representation. After learning, different views of the same object are represented in a connected neighborhood of neurons. Model neurons of a higher processing area that receive unspecific input from a local neighborhood in the map show view-invariant selectivities for visual objects. The findings suggest a functional relevance of cortical topographic maps.},

	Abstract = {A free-energy principle has been proposed recently that accounts for action, perception and learning. This Review looks at some key brain theories in the biological (for example, neural Darwinism) and physical (for example, information theory and optimal control theory) sciences from the free-energy perspective. Crucially, one key theme runs through each of these theories - optimization. Furthermore, if we look closely at what is optimized, the same quantity keeps emerging, namely value (expected reward, expected utility) or its complement, surprise (prediction error, expected cost). This is the quantity that is optimized under the free-energy principle, which suggests that several global brain theories might be unified within a free-energy framework.},

In our method, locations of sound sources and recording devices, and the recording time offsets are estimated from observed time differences of arrivals (TDOAs) by decreasing the mean squared errors. The auxiliary-function-based updates guarantee the monotonic decrease of the objective function at each iteration. The TDOAs are estimated by the generalized cross correlation technique.

	Abstract = {Signal processing in the cerebral cortex is thought to involve a common multi-purpose algorithm embodied in a canonical cortical micro-circuit that is replicated many times over both within and across cortical regions. Operation of this algorithm produces widely distributed but coherent and relevant patterns of activity. The theory of Coherent Infomax provides a formal specification of the objectives of such an algorithm. It also formally derives specifications for both the short-term processing dynamics and for the learning rules whereby the connection strengths between units in the network can be adapted to the environment in which the system finds itself. A central assumption of the theory is that the local processors can combine reliable signal coding with flexible use of those codes because they have two classes of synaptic connection: driving connections which specify the information content of the neural signals, and contextual connections which modulate that signal processing. Here, we make the biological relevance of this theory more explicit by putting more emphasis upon the contextual guidance of ongoing processing, by showing that Coherent Infomax is consistent with a particular Bayesian interpretation for the contextual guidance of learning and processing, by explicitly specifying rules for on-line learning, and by suggesting approximations by which the learning rules can be made computationally feasible within systems composed of very many local processors.},

	Abstract = {How the brain processes complex sounds, like voices or musical instrument sounds, is currently not well understood. The features comprising the acoustic profiles of such sounds are thought to be represented by neurons responding to increasing degrees of complexity throughout auditory cortex, with complete auditory "objects" encoded by neurons (or small networks of neurons) in anterior superior temporal regions. Although specialized voice and speech-sound regions have been proposed, it is unclear how other types of complex natural sounds are processed within this object-processing pathway. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we sought to demonstrate spatially distinct patterns of category-selective activity in human auditory cortex, independent of semantic content and low-level acoustic features. Category-selective responses were identified in anterior superior temporal regions, consisting of clusters selective for musical instrument sounds and for human speech. An additional subregion was identified that was particularly selective for the acoustic-phonetic content of speech. In contrast, regions along the superior temporal plane closer to primary auditory cortex were not selective for stimulus category, responding instead to specific acoustic features embedded in natural sounds, such as spectral structure and temporal modulation. Our results support a hierarchical organization of the anteroventral auditory-processing stream, with the most anterior regions representing the complete acoustic signature of auditory objects.},

	Abstract = {We propose a two-stagelearning method which implements occluded visual scene analysis into a generative model, a type of hierarchical neural network with bi-directional synaptic connections. Here, top-down connections simulate forwardoptics to generate predictions for sensory driven low-level representation, whereas bottom-up connections function to send the prediction error, the difference between the sensory based and the predicted low-level representation, to higher areas. The prediction error is then used to update the high-level representation to obtain better agreement with the visual scene. Although the actual forwardoptics is highly nonlinear and the accuracy of simulated forwardoptics is crucial for these types of models, the majority of previous studies have only investigated linear and simplified cases of forwardoptics. Here we take occludedvision as an example of nonlinearforwardoptics, where an object in front completely masks out the object behind. We propose a two-staged learning method inspired by the staged development of infant visual capacity. In the primary learningstage, a minimal set of object basis is acquired within a linear generative model using the conventional unsupervised learning scheme. In the secondary learningstage, an auxiliary multi-layer neural network is trained to acquire nonlinearforwardoptics by supervised learning. The important point is that the high-level representation of the linear generative model serves as the input and the sensory driven low-level representation provides the desired output. Numerical simulations show that occluded visual scene analysis can indeed be implemented by the proposed method. Furthermore, considering the format of input to the multi-layer network and analysis of hidden-layer units leads to the prediction that whole object representation of partially occluded objects, together with complex intermediate representation as a consequence of nonlinear transformation from non-occluded to occluded representation may exist in the low-level visual system of the brain.},

Two gratings, one a fixed test and the other a variable orientation masker were tagged with distinct temporal frequencies and the corresponding evoked responses were measured at the harmonics of the test and masker frequencies and at a frequency equal to the sum of the two stimulus frequencies. The magnitude of the sum frequency component depended strongly on the relative orientation of the test and masker in both infants and adults. The VEP tuning bandwidths of the 3-month-olds measured at the sum frequency were similar to those of adults, suggesting that behavioral immaturities in functions such as orientation discrimination and contour integration may result from other immaturities in long-range lateral projections or feedback mechanisms.},

The phenomenology of visual perceptions can be explained, however, in terms of empirical associations that link images whose meanings are inherently undetermined to their behavioral significance.

	Abstract = {One important task for the visual system is to group image elements that belong to an object and to segregate them from other objects and the background. We here present an incremental grouping theory (IGT) that addresses the role of object-based attention in perceptual grouping at a psychological level and, at the same time, outlines the mechanisms for grouping at the neurophysiological level. The IGT proposes that there are two processes for perceptual grouping. The first process is base grouping and relies on neurons that are tuned to feature conjunctions. Base grouping is fast and occurs in parallel across the visual scene, but not all possible feature conjunctions can be coded as base groupings. If there are no neurons tuned to the relevant feature conjunctions, a second process called incremental grouping comes into play. Incremental grouping is a time-consuming and capacity-limited process that requires the gradual spread of enhanced neuronal activity across the representation of an object in the visual cortex. The spread of enhanced neuronal activity corresponds to the labeling of image elements with object-based attention.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal populations in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mammals exhibit contrast normalization. Neurons that respond strongly to simple visual stimuli - such as sinusoidal gratings - respond less well to the same stimuli when they are presented as part of a more complex stimulus which also excites other, neighboring neurons. This phenomenon is generally attributed to generalized patterns of inhibitory connections between nearby V1 neurons. The Bienenstock, Cooper and Munro (BCM) rule is a neural network learning rule that, when trained on natural images, produces model neurons which, individually, have many tuning properties in common with real V1 neurons. However, when viewed as a population, a BCM network is very different from V1 - each member of the BCM population tends to respond to the same dominant features of visual input, producing an incomplete, highly redundant code for visual information. Here, we demonstrate that, by adding contrast normalization into the BCM rule, we arrive at a neurally-plausible Hebbian learning rule that can learn an efficient sparse, overcomplete representation that is a better model for stimulus selectivity in V1. This suggests that one role of contrast normalization in V1 is to guide the neonatal development of receptive fields, so that neurons respond to different features of visual input.},

	Abstract = {Shape representation is accomplished by a series of cortical stages in which cells in the first stage (V1) have local receptive fields tuned to contrast at a particular scale and orientation, each well modeled as a Gabor filter. In succeeding stages, the representation becomes largely invariant to Gabor coding (Kobatake \& Tanaka, 1994). Because of the non-Gabor tuning in these later stages, which must be engaged for a behavioral response (Tong, 2003; Tong et al., 1998), a V1-based measure of shape similarity based on Gabor filtering would not be expected to be highly correlated with human performance when discriminating complex shapes (faces and teeth-like blobs) that differ metrically on a two-choice, match-to-sample task. Here we show that human performance is highly correlated with Gabor-based image measures (Gabor simple and complex cells), with values often in the mid 0.90s, even without discounting the variability in the speed and accuracy of performance not associated with the similarity of the distractors. This high correlation is generally maintained through the stages of HMAX, a model that builds upon the Gabor metric and develops units for complex features and larger receptive fields. This is the first report of the psychophysical similarity of complex shapes being predictable from a biologically motivated, physical measure of similarity. As accurate as these measures were for accounting for metric variation, a simple demonstration showed that all were insensitive to viewpoint invariant (nonaccidental) differences in shape.},

	Abstract = {The intrinsic complexity of the brain can lead one to set aside issues related to its relationships with the body, but the field of embodied cognition emphasizes that understanding brain function at the system level requires one to address the role of the brain-body interface. It has only recently been appreciated that this interface performs huge amounts of computation that does not have to be repeated by the brain, and thus affords the brain great simplifications in its representations. In effect the brain?s abstract states can refer to coded representations of the world created by the body.
But even if the brain can communicate with the world through abstractions, the severe speed limitations in its neural circuitry mean that vast amounts of indexing must be performed during development so that appropriate behavioral responses can be rapidly accessed. One way this could happen would be if the brain used a decomposition whereby behavioral primitives could be quickly accessed and combined. This realization motivates of our study of independent sensorimotor task solvers, which we call modules, in directing behavior.
The issue we focus on herein is how an embodied agent can learn such individual visuomotor modules while pursuing multiple goals. The biologically plausible standard for module programming is that of reinforcement given during exploration of the environment. However this formulation contains a substantial issue when sensorimotor modules are used in combination: The credit for their overall performance must be divided amongst them. We show that this problem can be solved and that diverse task combinations are beneficial in learning and not a complication, as usually assumed. Our simulations show that fast algorithms are available that allot credit correctly and are insensitive to measurement noise.
